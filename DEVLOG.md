Alright I am back on, I got some sleep, since my sleep pattern is so f'd I gotta do a 32hr day between today and tomorrow... gonna succkkkkk

labor work is seeming more inevitable so next week will be just for me

I will get this working so I can move past this "is the monocle charging or not?" business

it seems that monocle will not show up in scan if it's already connected to... which is interesting since for Web I can connect to multiple devices at once

I also have not figured out yet how to verify that I'm connected/write to it
