Was up for over 6 hrs, disconnected...

- [x] button still says disconnect.
- [x] won't let go of monocle connection so other devices can pair to it
- [ ] not detecting that monocle no longer responsive

Looks like there is a way to turn the monocle off and check if bt connected... might add some kind of self rescue there...

Sucks loops in `main.py` seem problematic right now
