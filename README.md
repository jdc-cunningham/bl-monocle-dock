### About

This produces a wav file to be played on host OS eg. win 10 or whatever you write code with.

It's just a way to test if the mic is working.

### Note

You need to flash the `monocle_main.py` file onto your monocle that compliments the `main.py` file that runs on your computer ofr this to work.
